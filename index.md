# Milkshakes

Hello, and welcome to my collection of milkshakes and blends.

## What are these milkshakes?

Milkshakes are small little projects of various art I made in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), a 3D rendering program. Each milkshake has a name, a description, and the actual image.

## Why are they called milkshakes?

Because calling them "3D art renders" is boring.

## Can I use an image in my project?
